                there and Welcome!
                <br>
                My name is Emma Bixler and I am an Integration Specialist for a start-up tech company in New York. I am
                orginally from Philadelphia, Pa where I reside in the city that never sleeps.
                I attended at The Pennsylvania State University (WE ARE!) for undergrad, majoring in Bio Behavioral
                Health.
                When I am not working, I am a student at Columbia University taking a coding course to become a Full
                Stack Developer.
                The reason why I am taking this course is to seek new opportunity and also I would like to enhance my
                skills. Having this skills and knowledge will help me with my day to day tasks at work. When I am not
                in class, I am either studying, hanging out with friends, doing yoga or eating. <br>
                Hope you have fun exploring the site!!!!
